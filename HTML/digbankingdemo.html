If you have a joint checking account, you will be responsible for all advances, including interest and charges, from your credit card to cover overdrafts, regardless of who writes the check, makes the debit card purchase, or engages in any other transaction that causes the overdraft. Depending on your account terms, an Overdraft Protection Advance Fee may be charged to your Account each day an Overdraft Protection Advance is made, and interest will accrue from the date each advance is made. Your credit card must be activated; if it is not activated, no money will transfer to cover the overdraft. Once your credit card has been activated, please allow up to 3 business days for your Overdraft Protection service to be fully enabled. Refer to the Consumer Credit Card Customer Agreement and Disclosure Statement for details. Please note that you may also be able to link your TGK savings account to your TGK checking account for Overdraft Protection. No interest is charged on Overdraft Protection transfers from your savings account; however, Overdraft Protection transfers from a savings account count towards the Regulation D and TGK combined total limit of 6 transfers and withdrawals per monthly fee period. If the limit is exceeded, an excess activity fee for each transfer or withdrawal will be assessed. If the limit is exceeded on more than an occasional basis, your savings account could be converted to a checking account or closed.</p>

In consideration of the issuance of this secured credit card account, you have authorized TGK Bank, N.A. to open a deposit account with your security deposit called the "Secured Card Collateral Account" (the "Collateral Account") in your name. To secure all of your obligations arising under this credit card account, you assign, transfer, pledge, grant a security interest in, and set over to the bank all rights, title, and interest in the Collateral Account/Security Deposit&nbsp;and in all renewals, additions and proceeds of the Collateral Account, You agree that this security interest, pledge, and assignment includes and gives the Bank the right to redeem, collect and withdraw any part or the full amount of the Collateral Account upon any default under the Agreement or in the event your secured credit card account is terminated for any reason. You acknowledge and agree that this security interest, pledge, and assignment means that the bank has exclusive control over the Collateral Account, You may not make any withdrawals from the Collateral Account while it secures your credit card. The Secured Card Collateral Account is a non-interest bearing account, therefore no interest will be paid to you on the Collateral Account. This security interest, pledge, and assignment is given as security for any and all amounts you may owe, including but not limited to interest, fees and charges which may accrue under your secured credit card account. You agree that if the secured credit card account is closed for any reason, the bank may apply funds in the Collateral Account to pay off any balance on the credit card account. If there are still funds remaining in the Collateral Account after doing so, these funds may remain on deposit for up to 60 days before being remitted to you by electronic transfer to the TGK checking or savings account that was used to fund the original deposit. If the account is no longer open, or the collateral account was funded using cash or a check, you will receive a check for any remaining funds for the collateral deposit in the mail. If you are no longer on the account that you used to fund the original security deposit, you must notify TGK of this before or at the time of closure to prevent electronic transfer of the security deposit to the funding account.</p>

                        Cellular Telephone Protection can reimburse the eligible TGK Consumer Credit Card cardholder for damage to or theft of a cell phone. Reimbursement is limited to the repair or replacement of your original cell phone, less a $25 deductible with a maximum benefit limit of $600 per claim and $1,200 per 12 month period. <strong>This benefit does not cover cell phones that are lost (i.e. disappear without explanation).</strong> This protection is only available when cell phone bills are paid from your TGK Consumer Credit Card. The coverage does not apply if the cell phone bill is paid from a TGK Debit Card, TGK Business Credit Card, TGK Commercial Card or from the card that is linked to a Line of Credit. Coverage does not apply to cell phones that are rented, borrowed, or received as part of a prepaid plan. Electronic failure or issues related to the software of the device are not covered. Cellular Telephone Protection coverage&nbsp;begins the first day of the calendar month following your first cell phone billing on your TGK Consumer Credit Card, and remains in effect when you continue to charge your total monthly cell phone bill to your TGK Consumer Credit Card. This protection may not be equivalent to or better than other applicable coverage. This is supplemental coverage not otherwise covered by another insurance policy (for example, cell phone insurance programs, or your homeowner's, renter's, automobile, or employer's insurance policies) and may be applied after all other insurance. For complete coverage benefits and exclusions regarding this protection call 1-800-642-4720.<br>

                        <strong>Note:</strong> Call your cellular provider (or log on to their website) and request to set up automatic payments. Setting up automatic payments is not required to qualify for&nbsp;Cellular Telephone Protection; however, you need to pay your monthly cell phone bill with your eligible TGK Consumer Credit Card to get up to $600 protection.

The Bank may also use any other legal remedy to recover the amount.</p>

Any sums in a joint account may be paid, on request, to any owner without regard to whether any other owner is then incapacitated or deceased or whether the account includes a right of survivorship. If your Collateral Account does include a right of survivorship and one of you dies, the Collateral Account is payable to any survivor, subject to the Bank’s right of setoff and security interest. If your Collateral Account does not include a right of survivorship and one of you dies, the Collateral Account may, subject to the Bank’s right of setoff and security interest, be paid to any survivor or to the personal representative, heirs or successors of the deceased owner even though not the last surviving owner. The Bank has no obligation to separately account for each of your interests in the Collateral Account. An owner may supply an endorsement of another owner. The Bank may act on the instructions of any owner; however, instructions to remove an owner’s name or restrict an owner’s use may only be made by the owner whose name is to be removed or whose use is to be restricted, by that owner’s legal representative(s) or by court order. Subject to the terms of this Collateral Account Agreement, the Bank may close the Collateral Account on the instructions of any one of you or your legal representative(s).</p>

The Bank has the right to pursue collection of such Items, even to the extent of allowing the payor bank to hold an Item beyond the midnight deadline in an attempt to recover payment. These collection efforts may include sending such Items back for collection one or more times. The Bank will have no liability for resubmitting or not resubmitting these Items (or for taking any other action it considers reasonable to recover payment) without notice to you.</p>

If it does, it may send the balance by ordinary mail to the last address the Bank has for you in its records. Payment may be in cash, by cashier's check or bank draft. Before closing your Collateral Account, it will give you any notice required by law. You may not close the Collateral Account until your obligations under the Agreement have been fully paid and the credit card account is closed. We may use the security&nbsp;deposit funds in this Collateral Account to pay any balances on your credit card account. You agree that if the credit card account issued to you by the Bank is closed for any reason, the Bank may apply the funds in this Collateral Account to pay off any balance on the credit card account. We may hold funds in this Collateral Account for a minimum holding period of sixty days after the credit card balance is paid in full and the credit card account is closed in order to cover transactions that may be posted to the credit card account after it is closed.</p>
